### Second-Brain

A modern web application built with TypeScript, featuring a client-server architecture designed for [*specific functionality to be defined by maintainer*].

**Tech Stack:**

- TypeScript (96.1%)
- HTML (1.6%)
- CSS (1.2%)
- JavaScript (1.1%)


### Key Features

- Full-stack architecture with separate client and server components
- Modern TypeScript implementation
- [*Additional features to be documented based on actual functionality*]


## Technical Architecture

### Project Structure

The repository follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct client and server directories[^1]:

```
13-second-brain/
├── client/          # Frontend application
├── server/          # Backend services
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```


### Technology Decisions

The project leverages TypeScript as the primary language, which provides several advantages for development and maintenance[^4]. The package.json file serves as the core configuration file that defines dependencies, scripts, and project metadata[^9].

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)[^18]
- npm or yarn package manager


### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manojCodes77/13-second-brain.git
cd 13-second-brain
```

2. **Install client dependencies:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

3. **Install server dependencies:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```


### Development Setup

Based on common Node.js project patterns, the following scripts are typically available in the package.json file[^4]:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start production server
npm start
```


## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Start the server:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

2. **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

3. **Access the application:**
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

### Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables or configuration files. Create a `.env` file in the each directory (client and server) to set up environment-specific variables[^3]. For more convience , I have provided an .example.env file in both directories. You can rename it to .env and set your own values.


## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure

The project maintains a clear separation between client and server code, following modern web development best practices[^7]. This architecture allows for:

- Independent deployment of frontend and backend components
- Scalable development workflow
- Clear separation of concerns


### Package Management

The project uses npm for dependency management. Always commit the package-lock.json file to ensure consistent dependency versions across different environments[^2]. This practice helps maintain:

- Deterministic builds
- Consistent dependency versions across team members
- Reduced deployment issues


### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request

### Code Quality

- Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Follow established coding conventions
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed


## API Documentation

[*This section should be populated with actual API endpoints and documentation*]

### Endpoints

```
GET    /api/[endpoint]     # Description of endpoint
POST   /api/[endpoint]     # Description of endpoint
PUT    /api/[endpoint]     # Description of endpoint
DELETE /api/[endpoint]     # Description of endpoint
```


## Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Build the client
cd client
npm run build

# Build the server
cd ../server
npm run build
```


### Environment Setup

Ensure proper environment variables are configured for production deployment. Consider using platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS for hosting.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts:** Ensure the specified ports are available
2. **Dependency issues:** Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies
3. **Build failures:** Check TypeScript compilation errors
